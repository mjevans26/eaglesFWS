# Introduction

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) uses a bayesian framework to develop a statisticl model predicting eagle collisions, and fatalities, at proposed wind energy sites.  The appeal of Bayesian modeling is the ability to incorporate prior information and uncertainty regarding parameter values into posterior estimates, ideally a closer representation of reality.  However, as Bayesian methodology is less familiar , there remains confusion over how this prior information functions.  Additionally, .  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate and quantify the effects of prior on the predicted outcomes of the eagle motality model, in terms of .  We use both empirical data from Bay et al. (2016), as well as a simulated dataset to demonstrate these effects both in theory and in practice.

# Empirical Data

We used an empirical dataset from Appendix A in [Bay et al. (2016)](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/13/3563.full?tab=ds), presenting pre-construction eagle survey data from 26 wind energy sites.  We calculated survey effort as the survey area in km<sup>3</sup>, coverted from hectares, multiplied by 0.2 km, times the reported observation time in hrs.

The influence of eagle exposure priors on estimated eagle fatalities was less for wind energy projects that expended greater effort on pre-construction surveys.  This pattern is indicated by the sites with the most intensive surveys falling closest to a 1:1 relationship between the two estimates (Fig. 1).  The use of prior exposure information produced a higher estimate of eagle take at a majority of sites (Fig. 1) than would have been produced using site-survey data only. These instances are indicated by points above the 1:1 line in Figure 1.

# Simulation Study

###Generating Data Based on FWS Requirements

To investigate the effects of prior information and survey effort on predicted take, we created a dataset representing a range of possible pre-construction survey values for plot area, time, and eagle observations.  We based these values on the minimum requirements provided by U.S. FWS for pre-construction monitoring.  FWS requires at least one cylindrical survey plot with radius > 800m and height > 200m, and that plots be surveyed for at least 12 hours per year, for two years.  Thus, the minimum values for survey area and time were `r min(area)` km<sup>3</sup>, and `r min(time)` hrs, respectively.  We simulated up to five plots (area = `r max(area)`) in increments of one, and up to  `r max(time)` hrs in increments of 12, and calculated survey effort for all combinations.  Finally, we used the maximum observed value for eagle flight time (min) from Bay et al. (2016) to generate a range of values from 0, incrementing by 50.  The final simulation data included all combinations of survey effort and observed eagle activity, producing 1050 values.   

```{r eval = FALSE}
flight <- seq(0, 1000, 50)
time <- seq(1, 10, 1)*12*2
area <- seq(0.402, 2.01, 0.402)
df <- expand.grid(TIME = time, AREA = area, a = flight)
sim <- plyr::mdply(df[, c(3,4)], estimates, niters = 10000)
```

We then predicted at each combination of survey effort and eagle observation values, and report the mean, and 80% quantiles of the posterior distributions.  To generate predictions, we used the updated FWS priors for collision rate (XXX), and a.  FWS service uses a scaling factor based on the size, and hours of operation of a wind farm, to translate these per km3 estimates into predicted annual number of eagle fatalities. 

### Greater Survey Effort Reduces Effect of Priors
For eagle activity rates < 1.5 min/survey effort, predicted fatlity rates are higher when estimated using priors, than without (i.e. above the 1:1 line in Fig. 2).  The trend reverses when activity rates are > 1.5.  1.5 was the mean observed activity rate, the prior distribution.  Thus, Figure 2 also illustrates that predicted fatalities estimated with and without priors are closer when survey effort is greater (i.e., larger circles).

    )
  )
)
```


Increased survey effort reduces the influence of prior exposure on posterior estimates, resulting in less discrepacy between predictions obtained using priors, and those obtained using site survey data only.  Similarly, the size of 80% CI from posterior estimates decreases as survey efforts increase (Fig. 3), indicating less uncertainty around fatality predictions.  As the 80% CI is used by FWS in permitting and determining mitigation requirements

Survey effort is used to adjust the rate parameter of the gamma distribution used to define the eagle exposure prior.  Thus, increased survey effort leads to a narrower posterior distribution, and smaller 80% CI.  In practice, this makes sense, as we have greater confidence that the results of more intensive surveys are reflective of consistent patterns, rather than conditions during a limited number of instances.  

# Policy Implications

### Federal Agencies Have Been Spending Less on Listed Species
The primary findings are that .  Simulation data can be used by both FWS and wind energy developers to understand and anticipate how survey data and prior information may produce .

An important question is when do priors significantly overpredict (bad because of undue restrictions on developers) versus underpredict.

The results of our simulation study indicate that the effor expended during pre-construction surveys has a significant effect on reducing the influence of prior information on predicted eagle fatalities at a given site.
